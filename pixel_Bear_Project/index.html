                As the development of virtual worlds and virtual reality continues to advance, we are starting to notice the appearance of curious virtual creatures. We know that they’re living creatures because there is no code or apparent source dictating their behavior and they seem to actually have a mind of their own. 
                Additionally, in an effort to research its behavior (and the degree of its sentience), researchers are attempting to move it into different environments to observe its reactions. 
                At some point, the temporary habitat will shift into something similar to a 3D / real-life environment that we humans live in…

                If you drag it too fast too many times, it might feel triggered. Pixel Bear won't always follow right away, so please pull nicely...
